OpenPnP-OpenBuilds
==================

An OpenPnP compatible SMT pick and place machine based on [OpenBuilds](http://openbuildspartstore.com/) linear motion components.

Current Status: Pre-Alpha

CAD files are created in Cubify Design ( http://cubify.com/Products/Design ) which has a 14 day fully functional free demo and is $199.00 to purchase. I highly recommend it.
