OpenPnP-OpenBuilds
==================

An OpenPnP compatible SMT pick and place machine based on [OpenBuilds](http://openbuildspartstore.com/) linear motion components.

Current Status: In Development

CAD files are created in Cubify Design ( http://cubify.com/Products/Design ) which has a 14 day fully functional free demo and is $199.00 to purchase. I highly recommend it.

Note that BoM is rough and several items are estimates. This machine was built as a prototype piece by piece, so it may be possible to purchase many of the items elsewhere for less cost. In addition, many items are purchased in large quantities when only a few are needed.

Note also that general hardware is not included in the BOM. There is a note for the hardware line item that reads:

You will need a huge variety of metric hardware. Full listing to come later. I recommend buying every size of M2, M3 and M5 Zinc Coated Phillips Pan Head from about 8mm to 25mm, along with regular nuts, nylock nuts, split lock washers and flat washers for each.

There are currently no build instructions. I will be posting detailed pictures and some drawings in the week to come.
