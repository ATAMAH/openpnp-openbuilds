OpenPnP-OpenBuilds
==================

An OpenPnP compatible SMT pick and place machine based on [OpenBuilds](http://openbuildspartstore.com/) linear motion components.

Current Status: In Development

IMPORTANT NOTE - READ THIS FIRST
---
This machine was built as a prototype and development platform. It is not a final or even recommended design. This build allowed me to test out many ideas and to develop of the head, which is fairly stable. The next iteration of this design will have a much lower part count and be much easier to build. The head design will remain quite similar but the X/Y stage will be changing to linear rods and 3D printed supports.

CAD
---
CAD files are created in Cubify Design ( http://cubify.com/Products/Design ) which has a 14 day fully functional free demo and is $199.00 to purchase. I highly recommend it.

Note that the BOM is rough and several items are estimates. This machine was built as a prototype piece by piece, so it may be possible to purchase many of the items elsewhere for less cost. In addition, many items are purchased in large quantities when only a few are needed.

Hardware
---
Note that general hardware is not included in the BOM. You will need a huge variety of metric hardware. Full listing to come later. I recommend buying every size of M2, M3 and M5 Zinc Coated Phillips Pan Head from about 8mm to 25mm, along with regular nuts, nylock nuts, split lock washers and flat washers for each. McMaster is a good source for this hardware.
